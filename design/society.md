#Society
A mostly agrarian, feudal society. Kings and their vassals squabble as they have always done but the greater status quo has been preserved for the last few generations. This period of relative peace has given the people opportunity for other things than fighting and farming.

##Race
Three civilized races inhabit Caedon. The language is shared among the races. An ancient elvish language exists but is almost never spoken but many ancient chronicles and treatises are written in it.

###Humans
The most populous race, humans are as diverse as nature itself. Characterised by a desire to learn and understand. Adapting to any situation, humans have built settlements all over Caedon, primarily along its shores, rivers and lakes. Anyone who can contribute is welcome to stay.

###Elves
An ancient race of fair and wise people. Connected to the world and its magic. While not hostile to outsiders most elves prefer to live in all-elven communities. Longer-lived than the other races they value history and record it in chronicles for later generations to learn.

###Dwarves
Standing about a foot shorter than the average human, dwarves value the arts of crafting. Among the fiercest fighters - what they lack in reach they more than make up for in strength. Cunning and eager, dwarves make excellent businessmen.

##Kinship and family structure
All three races can and do reproduce between them, but half-born are themselves sterile. There is little stigma to being half-born. Since half-borns are sterile, their relationships are dedicated to self-fulfillment rather than reproduction - homosexuality and polyamorosity is common in half-borns, but rare in full-borns. 

For unknown reasons, half-borns are usually more attuned with magic than pureborns.

##Economy
A production-centric economy, with farming, husbandry and fishing. Only the major cities have a service based economy. Artisans of all kinds run often highly specialised shops, due to insight into specific planar affinities. Prostitution is legal almost everywhere, and both men and women offer their services.

###Money
The common currency is called tag (<>) and is technically a unit of weight (about 15 grams). Can be divided into 60 bits. A tag is about a days wage for an unskilled laborer. Generally speaking at an average inn 10-12 bits will get you a decent meal, 25-35 bits gets you a bed for the night.

The coins are made of irrum, an uncommon noble metal with an unmistakable iridescent shine and relatively light weight. Nominally all transactions are conducted by weight of irrum, but standard coins come in 10<>, 5<>, <>, 30b ('half-tag'), 20b ('third-tag'), 12b ('fifth-tag'), 6b ('tenth-tag'), 1b. The tag coin is square with a side of about 5cm and about 2mm thick. Bits are simply a <> cut into pieces. It is easy and completely legal to melt down coins and mint your own as long, since even small impurities in the irrum makes it lose its luster and are easily spotted. Coins are traditionally marked with the coat of arms of the city they were minted in.
