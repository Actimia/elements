#World
The diverse continent of Caedon and its surrounding islands. There are other continents on the planet, but our story is focused on Caedon.

##Nature
Old primordial forests cover vast areas of the mainland. While not impassable, travellers would do well to keep to the roads. The further north one goes, the colder it gets. Mountain ranges and rivers provide natural boundaries. Ruins of mysterious origin are spread throughout the world.
