#Anya Narii
Race: Elf

Bright green eyes and blonde hair, a true elf-maiden. Born to poor farmers outside Greystone her early life was not easy. At the age of 12 her parents died and she became an orphan at the Church-run orphanage in Greystone. Always hungry for knowledge it did not take long until she was discovered a mage at the church and was given a proper education in the elemental arts. The art of water magic came easy to her. After having learnt what the mage could teach her, she had been accepted into the Water college on the island at Sapphire Bay at the age of 19. With everything she owned in a small backpack she secured transport across the Windy Sea with a cargo crew. 

Dressed in a robe that was way too warm for the climate in Sapphire Bay she disembarked and started the short trek to the college, having triple checked her admission papers. Always logical and analytic of any situation, she noted the shops on the streets leading up to the college. She would need to find some work if she were to have any spare money the coming years. The College itself was without tuition but food and board was not free. She only had about 5<> in her purse, enough for a week or two.

As she turned a corner and spotted a herbalist's shop she pictured herself weighing herbs and making ointments. "Not for me" she thought and her gaze turned across the street to what appeared to be a jewelers shop. "That would be better", she thought and her hand automatically went to the amulet around her neck. It was very simple, just a piece of twine holding a small round piece of tin inscribed with 'Hali', the deity of water. But she had made it herself and while the materials were simple she had put a lot of effort into the process. If she had a few extra tags she would buy a new one with better affinities. She hesitated for a second but decided to go in to the jewelers shop - they weren't expecting her at the college anyway and it was still before lunchtime.

"Hello", a mans voice said as she entered the shop. "How can I help you?". "Just looking", she responded with a smile and looked around. Display cases adorned the walls and the counter in the small shop. The man behind the counter was an older dwarf, dressed in green and brown with a ginger beard. "New to the college?" he asked. "How did you know?", Anya responded a bit too quickly. "Well, for one you are wearing Church robes. But that cut looks awfully warm a day like this.". It was true, she was sweating quite a bit under her robes. She smiled and said "I just got off the boat from Greystone". The dwarf behind the counter replied "Ah, Greystone. Never been myself. What will you study here?" She hesitated, "I'm not quite sure yet. I like purifying and healing, but aquamancy also sounds like fun." The dwarf guffawed, "I wouldn't do aquamancy, no future in soothsaying from what I've heard." and let out a deep laugh. Anya smirked and said "First year is a basic course anyway, so there is still time to decide." The dwarf's eye went to her chest, where her pendant was resting above her robe. "Nice necklace. Hali's always a good deity to have on your side. Make it yourself?". Anya blushed a bit, she was not used to getting compliments for her work. She said "Yes, but I could not afford materials with a decent affinity." The dwarf said "Hmm, mind if I take a closer look?". 

She unclasped her necklace beneath her hair, which she had had in a simply ponytail to keep it out of her eyes while at sea. She handed the necklace across the counter and released her ponytail while the dwarf inspected it. "Well," he said after a while. "The inscription is too good for the material. I got some good ones if you are looking for an upgrade." Anya hesitated a bit. She could not deny she wanted a new necklace. Being raised an orphan had made her long for the status symbols she had seen on other people. But her purse, while a whole lot fuller than it had usually been was loaned to her by her mentor in Greystone. Spending it all the very first day would not be a wise choice. "I'm sorry," she said, "but I dont think I can afford a new necklace right now." The dwarf handed her necklace back and said with a smile, "I understand. First time away from your parents and you don't wanna have to write home for more money the first week." She hesitated again, unsure what to say next. "I don't really have a home to write for more money even if I needed. I'm kinda on my own." The dwarf said "Oh I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...". Anya dismissed his apology with a smile, "Don't worry about it. You had no way of knowing." The dwarf returned her smile and changed the subject "I know you're not buying today, but can I show you something?" Anya nodded, curious about what he was about to show her. 

The dwarf walked over to a display case, procured a set of keys from his belt and unlocked an ornate glass display case. He took out a small amulet made of a silvery metal with a small bright green stone set amidst an inscription. She realised it must be worth hundreds of tags. "Here, try this on," the dwarf said. Her hands trembled a little as she clasped it behind her slender neck. "Can you read the inscription?", the dwarf asked her. She held it up for a closer look and quickly nodded. She recognised the glyphs as ancient elvish, a language she had been taught the basics of. "It is a prayer to Hali, but I cant make out the end" she said. "May Hali always bring us back to shore" he said. She felt something she couldn't explain when he uttered the incantation. "It is beautiful," she said absently while she held it up to look at its intricate details. It was shaped like a seashell with a the spherically cut stone set like a pearl in its middle. The inscription was engraved along the top. She wanted to ask how much it was but did not want to hear the answer. "Some day I am going to have a necklace like that", she said, as much to herself as to the dwarf standing next to her. The dwarf chuckled and said "You and your pendant made me think of this one. The stone is the exact color of your eyes." She looked over to a mirror nearby and realised the dwarf was right. She almost appeared as she had three eyes when the pendant laid on her breast. 

"What kind of stone is that?" she asked. She had studied stones for their planar properties but had never seen anything like this. "It is an unusual gem called apexite. Mined far from here. That is probably why I haven't sold it yet, the people here are most interested in sapphires". She made a mental note to research apexite more later. Unclasping the necklace she said "It really is a beautiful piece." The dwarf simply replied "Thank you". Anya remembered where she was headed and said "I should get going, I need to get to college admissions today." "Do you know where to go?" the dwarf asked. "No," Anya answered honestly. She had only seen the college as she had sailed into the harbor as it was very hard to miss on top of the hill. "Keep going up until you reach the college gates, but dont enter. The admissions office is outside the gates to the left. Only members allowed inside and all that." She thanked the dwarf and turned to leave. "Oh by the way, my name is Jona. Don't hesitate to come back if you need anything," the dwarf said with a smile. "Nice to meet you Jona, I'm Anya," she said as she returned his smile. She had liked Jona from beginning. "See you later then," she said as she stepped out into the hot mid-day sun. 

Feeling a bit hungry as she walked up the serpentine streets she checked her backpack and found an apple. As she came closer to the college she realised how big it must be, with several towers and buildings, all inside a great wall. She was unsure why the college needed a wall. She passed a Balance temple on her way up. She knew what the Balance was but being raised in a Church orphanage she did not pay it much attention. As she rounded the final corner she saw the gates where two burly looking battlemages guarded the entrance. She looked to the left and spotted a small sign that said 'Admissions'. Thankful for Jona's directions she made her way over and entered.

A human girl who looked a couple of years older than her was sitting behind a desk when she entered. She made her way forward and the girl behind the counter looked at her with a surly face and said "Yes?". "I'm here for admission," she started. "Papers, please" said the girl quickly. Anya got the papers from her backpack and handed them over. "Hmm," the clerk said after inspecting the papers, "Anya Narii... everything looks in order. You are hereby assigned to master Farwick. He will be in charge of getting you up to speed." She paused for a bit and checked a very thick book with what looked like schedules. "He is currently teaching an alchemy class but should be free to see you in an hour. Go to hall 7, room 56." Anya did not know where that was but figured she had some time to find out. "One more thing," the admissions girl said. "You will need this," she handed over a leather strap with a small badge at the end. "This is used for identification," she said in response to Anya's puzzled look. "Without this you will not get past the guards. Keep this on you at all times when on campus. The badge identifies you as one of us." Anya thanked her and asked for directions to hall 7, room 56. After getting directions that she did not quite understand, she thanked the girl and went outside.

"One of us" - the girls words still echoed in Anya's head. She had never felt like she belonged anywhere before but this just felt right. Approaching the gate, she saw people she assumed were other students enter by showing their leather strap to the guards. Theirs was more adorned with beads and other baubles. Anya approached the gate and showed the guard her strap. "Fresh meat," the guard said with a snarl but made no other comment. Anya did not mind, she had heard much worse on the streets of Greystone, and besides he was correct - here she was truly fresh meat.

Getting to hall 7, room 56 took her a bit longer than she thought as she got lost twice and had to ask for help from passing students. The corridors were markedly colder than outside, something she was thankful for. She peered through the window in the door and saw an old mage and a handful of students in a room filled with many strange apparatus she did not know the name or use of. She took a seat outside as she did not want to disturb the lesson. She fiddled with her necklace and thought back to the beautiful apexite stone that Jona had shown her.

After a little while the door flung open and the students came out. She gathered her courage and entered the alchemy room. The wizard was half-born elf and human and looked very old with a big grey beard. She cleared her throat and said "Excuse me." The wizard looked up from his papers and revealed a jovial looking face. "Yes?" the wizard said. "My name is Anya Narii and admissions said I was assigned to you." The wizards face flashed a smile and he exclaimed "Oh, how exciting! Welcome to the Water College!" Anya immedeately relaxed a bit and smiled back. "My name is master Pollin Farwick," said the wizard. "Please sit down," he added.

Anya moved forward and put her backpack on the ground next to a chair opposite master Farwick. She took another bunch of papers from her bag, this one a sealed letter from her previous tutor along with a sheet of what she had been taught so far. She handed them over, eager to learn what was in store for her. Master Farwick looked down, reached for a small knife to unseal the letter started reading.

"You did not start your education until you were orphaned?" he asked without taking his eyes of the letter. "Yes," Anya responded, unsure what the master made of this information. After finishing, he paused for a bit and said "Well you certainly have had an unusually late start to your education, but if your last tutor is correct you are more than up to speed." He opened a box in his desk and deposited the letters. "Lets talk a bit about what comes next. Do you have a place to live yet?" he asked of her. Anya quickly said "No, I came straight from the ship." "Okay, we will have to take care of that quickly," he said, "How is your financial situation?". Anya was not quite ready for the question but said "Not great. I have enough for a couple of weeks atleast but I intend to find work in the city." Master Farwick frowned slightly and said "I hope you know what you are in for. College is not easy and having work too leaves little time for other things in life." It did not matter to Anya, she knew would work tirelessly for this, as she had done previously. "I know it will be hard, but I don't have much choice, master." she responded. Master Farwick smiled at her and said with a smile "You seem to be made of sturdy stuff. I think you can do it".

The conversation turned to her further studies but when she indicated she might want to be a healer, the master had quickly interupted her and reminded her about the basic courses in the first year and not to pick a path before she knew what was available. She agreed with this advice. The rest of the meeting consisted of master Farwick asking her questions about subjects to gauge her knowledge level. This was exhausting as his questions could jump between subjects very quickly. Her schedule for the first month consisted of courses in Purifying, Alchemy, Planar Studies and Ancient Elvish. This left her some time for whatever work she could find. 

As she was walking out of the college the day had turned to afternoon and she realized she was very hungry. Not a new feeling to an orphan from the streets of Greystone. No - she was not an orphan any more. She was an apprentice of the water college. The sun had become a little bit milder but her robes were still quite hot. She passed a store she hadn't noticed on the way up, a small tailors shop. She was feeling quite tired but longed for something more comfortable to wear. Inside the store it smelt of newly dyed fabrics, and rolls of cloth lined the walls. She was greeted by the attendant and gave the young boy a smile back. She found a light cornflower blue silk robe with just the right amounts of pockets, and even though it was a bit more expensive than she had hoped she bought it and quickly changed into her new garment behind a divider in the shop. They felt much better than her old worn robes, which she stuffed into her backpack. Feeling refreshed, she slowly walked down the hill until she came to Jona's shop.

As she entered the jewelers shop she gave the dwarf a big smile, which he instantly returned and greeted her with "Nice robes". They chatted about her day for a while. When Anya mentioned she would need work to support her through college Jona made an expression Anya couldn't read. "Are you hungry?", he asked her. "I was just about to close up here and head home to my wife, you are welcome to join us for dinner." Anya immeadiately accepted his generous offer, she was aching for both food and company. Thankful for her earlier decision to go into his shop, she browsed the display cabinets for a while. After quickly looking over some rings with Balance symbols, she found a collection of amulets in a multitude of styles with inscriptions to various planar deities. Although none impressed her like the one he had shown her earlier, she was very fascinated with his level of craftsmanship.

Walking together to Jona's home took only a couple of minutes. Upon arrival, Anya was introduced to Sigyn, Jona's wife. Sigyn was a dwarf like her husband, with shoulder length brown hair and a friendly face. She liked her right away, much like she had with Jona. She helped with preparing a simple yet hearty meal. A small stain on her new robes was quickly fixed by a small purifying spell. Not its intended purpose from when she learned it from a book in Greystone, but adapting was a core part of magic knowledge. 

After dinner, Jona asked her about work. "Anya, do you have an idea of what kind of work you want?" he said. She paused for a while. "I saw the herbalist shop opposite yours. I don't want to work there," she said with a smile. Jona smiled back. With a more serious face he said "Well, I saw your pendant before and you truly do have some skill with an engraver. Why dont you work in my shop? I cant pay much, but there is a small room in the back where you could sleep." Anya was beside herself with joy at the offer, it was more than she had dared to hope for. "That sounds wonderful," she said. They talked for a while about her duties, both producing simple amulets to sell, and manning the front desk while Jona worked in the back.

They walked back to the shop to get her set up in the back room. It was small and windowless and the mattress had seen better days but none of that mattered to Anya. She set her backpack down on a chair and gave Jona a big hug, at which he blushed a bit. She had been very anxious about how she would support herself. The sailors on the ship over had told her stories of girls becoming courtesans to put themselves through college, and some had even tried to proposition her. That had stopped after she showed them a flash of magic. Not out of fear, but sailors respected aquamancers very highly and to their uneducated minds she was basically the arch-mage.

She slept very well that night. Awakening feeling refreshed she checked out her room more extensively it appeared it was some sort of storage, a cabinet held ingots of metals, both known and unknown to her, and tools adorned the walls. It was just after dawn and she wandered around the shop in the new light. A mirror hung next to a cabinet and she looked at herself. Her bright hair surrounded her symmetrical face. Back at the orphanage she had been the only elf her age. She knew she was considered beautiful but had never really thought of herself like that. But in the dawn light she could see what other people saw in her. She took a step back and looked at her robed body in the mirror. Fully figured breasts gave way to a thin waist and slender hips. She had never been intimate with anyone - not for a lack of trying from the boys in the orphanage. In her mind they were all stupid and uninteresting. She had focused on their studies while they were mostly focused on playing kickball.

Thinking of the necklace Jona had shown here yesterday she looked for it in the cabinet he had taken it from, but did not see it. Walking into the shop behind the counter, she found even more tools. On a desk was what appeared to be a business ledger. She saw an engraving station with some fine chisels and a simple ring in the vise. Taking a closer look the engraving went all the way around the ring, a vine with leaves and flowers. Jona was truly a master of his craft. She hoped she would not dissappoint him. Maybe she should practice? She loosened the vise carefully and put the ring to the side, and quickly found a small scrap piece of metal. Fastening it into the vise she grabbed a small chisel and hammer and started knacking away, A-N-Y-A. Under it she wrote H-A-L-I. What had started off quite bad and square came back to her quickly. Runescribing was an important part of some spells and her teachers in Greystone had lent her a small chisel, but she was severely out of practice, but delighted in the opportunity to practice. She traced out the ancient glyphs for Anya and had barely put the chisel to the metal before she heard a key in the shop door. She went out to greet Jona. He was happy to see her and asked how she had slept. She admitted she had slept well but not long. 

Walking back to the workshop he noticed her engraving. "Oh you found the engraving tools?" he exclaimed. "Hmm, not bad. This letter is off but im sure you knew that." She did know that. "Show me," he motioned to the seat in front of the vise. She sat down, a bit more nervous this time. Focusing intently this time, she started her delicate hammering. Almost right away Jona stopped her. "Hold it like this instead," he said as he reached down and corrected her grip on the chisel. After a while the inscription was finished, much nicer looking than the earlier practice she had done. "Good choice of material by the way," he said while inspecting her finished work. "Harder metal makes better practice," he continued. He motioned for her to get up from her seat and they switched places. She watched in awe as he fastened the vine ring in the vise again and within seconds he had made a new leaf, perfectly textured with the others on the vine. "Wow," she uttered in admiration. Jona smiled at her and said "Soon you will be doing that too."

The sound of a door opening put an end to the engraving lesson. They walked out in the main room and greeted the days first customer, and middle-aged elf lady whose earrings needed mending. A stone had been unseated. Anya stood to the side as Jona wrote down the details in a ledger. She had never liked having earrings. She had pierced her ears mostly out of peer pressure. The vain girls at the orphanage had resented her for her looks and brains. As the lady left her earrings were put in a small numbered envelope which was put in a cabinet in the workshop. Jona explained his system of keeping track of everything. Anya listened intently, not wanting to be the reason something got lost. Anya realized she had not had any breakfast, but decided to tough it out. Back in the workshop, she was given some metal blanks to practice on while Jona took out an envelope from the cabinet and started mending a broken necklace clasp. H-A-L-I she wrote on one of the blanks. Thinking she should put something else there, she attempted a decorative wave pattern around the text.
