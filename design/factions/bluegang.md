#Blue Gang
What started out as a group of criminals running a simple protection racket quickly grew to become the biggest organized crime group on the continent with presence in nearly every major settlement. The Blues, as their members are called, abide by strict rules and will not accept contracts against fellow members. While their fees are sky-high so are their completion rates. It is unknown who their leaders are and where their central seat is located, although theories and rumours run rampant - most likely as a result of misdirection campaigns orchestrated by themselves.
