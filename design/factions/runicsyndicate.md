#Planar Council
Membership in the Planar Council is reserved only for those mages showing extra-ordinary ability in the planar magical arts. Leaders of the Church of the Elements. The Council has many members, spread across several colleges. Most colleges focus on studying a single element, and are usually located in particularly affine locations.

Their leader, the Arch-Mage, is both a religious figure and an intellectual one.

The fact that no king's court or duke's entourage is complete without a highly trained mage has provided them one of the best intelligence gathering networks, which combined with their elemental insight makes them a true force to be reckoned with.
