#Mountain Sects
The ascetic mountain sects of the Balance are not commonly spoken of in the bigger cities, but they definitly do exist, and those who survive the treacherous journey to the peak monasteries can choose to become initiates, revoking all ownership of physical things and commiting to a life of study and piety. While the monks do not have any wealth or belongings, they have unparalleled mental fortitude and the amassed knowledge of generations of monks, especially in the areas of healing and spiritualism. Fully trained monks travel around the world, visiting Balance temples giving guidance, healing ills and leading ceremonies.
