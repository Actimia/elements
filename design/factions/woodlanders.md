#Woodlanders
More skilled than any others at surviving the natural dangers lurking in the world, the Woodlanders are rangers and guard the vast woodlands against any who would trespass in their sacred groves. This all-female league consists mostly of elves, but any Sister is treated equally if she can pass the grueling trials. Should she pass the trials and become a full-fledged Woodlander, the secrets of the woods are shared with her in rituals that no outsider have ever seen. They are the finest archers in Caedon, drilling endlessly to be ready for anything. In their sylvan sanctuaries master fletchers use the most affine wood from the deepest thickets to construct bows for the sisterhood.
