#Magic
There exists two kinds of magic in symbiosis with each other. Everything exists as a combination of the two. There are 'spells' in the traditional sense but magic is also more subtle, making things simply work better when in tune with its magic side.

##The plane
The first and most accessible is the elemental plane, which differentiates between fire and water, sky and earth. All natural things has its place on the plane, even if it might not be clear exactly where.

###Affinity
Everything has some affinity on this plane. Affinity can take many forms. Simple affinities are easy to understand - certain woods make better fires, certain metals conduct electricity better. More complex affinities needs more studies - such as amber being extremely affine to lightning. Many affinities are known but not completely understood.

These affinities work together - making an arrow from a fire-affine wood and a fire-affine head would make it much more susceptible to fire magic. 

##The axis
The other, the 'axis' is more difficult to both grasp and use. It is the difference between light and dark, life and death, rejuvenation and withering, female and male, order and chaos. Balance on this axis is essential, neither can exist without the other. Deviating too far to one side can have unforeseeable consequences. Small perturbances are natural and self-correcting.
