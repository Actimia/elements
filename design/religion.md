#Religion
The two major religions derive from the different kinds of magic, but coexist peacefully. People usually follow one faith or the other, there is no stigma against the other. It is not uncommon for people to observe both religions to some extent. Other, smaller religions do exist, but are usually local superstitions and not organized to the same extent.

##Church of the Elements
Followers pray to deities symbolising the elements. The exact number and name of deities varies by exact creed - the essential is the elements they embody. Their clerics, called mages, devote their life to studies of an element and its deities and affinities, and usually travel around giving sermons. In cities, chapters perform an essential role in communities - they providing basic healing services, feed the poor. Due to its community-centricness it is the most popular religion.

###Deities
Elements are personified as deities. These abstractions are created by the leaders of the church to help the masses understand. Even though they are open about it being an abstraction and not the literal truth, many deities are massively popular among followers. For example, Ayri is the female deity of water and an iconograph of her name is a very common tattoo for sailors and fishermen. The deities are also used as characters in tales of morality.

##The Balance
The Balance can be described more as a philosophy than as a religion. There are no deities, only balance itself. They study the cyclical nature of things and the joining of opposites into symmetries. Their temples are the sites of rituals to this purpose. They practice ritual sex, where the joining of male and female briefly form a more perfect shape. Homosexuality is not accepted.

###Feasts
During the year celebrations take place at important astronomical events - solstice, equinox, eclipses. These usually consist of communal feasts in the temples, events that are highly anticipated throughout the year. The winter solstice feast is dedicated to young adults finding a partner.

###Monks
Temples are led by a married male-female pair of monks. They lead their congregation together. The female monks wear an all-white robe, males wear all-black. Around their neck is their symbolic pendant, which shows their rank. An initiate is given a blank pendant which is later adorned with stones and other symbols as their knowledge grows. Ascending through the ranks of the Balance is no mean feat but would bring a wealth of knowledge about the world and its course.
